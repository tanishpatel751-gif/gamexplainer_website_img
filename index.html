     <h2> Monopoly </h2> 
     <p> Each player starts on the “Go” space with $1,500 in play money and takes turns rolling two dice to move clockwise around the board, collecting $200 whenever they land on or pass “Go”(Wikipedia & Official Game Rules). If you land on an unowned property, you may buy it at the listed price—or, if you decline, the banker auctions it to the highest bidder (Wikipedia & HowStuffWorks). Landing on another player's property requires paying rent, which is doubled when you own every property in a color group and can be increased further by building houses or hotels Wikipedia (HowStuffWorks).You go to Jail if you land on “Go to Jail,” draw a card that sends you there, or roll three consecutive doubles—and to get out, you must pay $50, use a Get Out of Jail Free card, or roll doubles within three turns 
(Wikipedia).Players can trade properties, mortgage them for cash (repaying with interest), and must continue until all but one are bankrupt—the remaining player wins Wikipedia(HowStuffWorks).

  <h2> Sorry </h2> 
  <p> 
   Each player places four pawns in their Start, and on your turn you draw a card and follow its instructions to move one pawn around the board clockwise or as directed (Wikipedia gametimehero.com).Certain cards (like 1 or 2) let you move a pawn from Start onto the track, with “2” also granting an extra draw (Wikipedia,Official Game Rules, gametimehero.com).Landing on an opponent's pawn bumps it back to their Start; you may also slide when landing on the beginning triangle of your color, sending all pawns on the slide back to their Starts (UltraBoardGames,Wikipedia,Official Game Rules).
Pawns must enter your Safety Zone and ultimately your Home by the exact card count, and once home, they stay put for the rest of the game (Wikipedia,
Official Game Rules). Bonus actions come with special cards: 11 lets you swap places with another pawn on the main track, and a Sorry! card allows you to take a pawn from Start and bump an opponent—if no pawn is in Start or no valid opponent pawn is on the board, you lose your turn (Wikipedia, ee0r.com, reddit.com).

 <h2>Catan</h2> 
 <p>

 Players take turns rolling two dice to generate resource cards—wood, brick, sheep, grain, or ore—based on their settlements’ or cities’ positions adjacent to hexes marked with the rolled number. During their turn, players may trade resources with others or via ports, then spend them to build roads, settlements, upgrade to cities, or purchase development cards, while using knights or rolling a 7 activates the robber to block resource production and steal. The winner is the first to reach 10 victory points through structures, cards, or achievements like Largest Army or Longest Road 
(Wikipedia,boardgameinformer.com).

 <h2> Chess </h2> 
 <p> 
Chess is played on an 8×8 board with each player starting with 16 pieces—one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns—each moving in its own way (e.g., the queen moves like rook and bishop, knights move in an “L‑shape,” pawns move forward and capture diagonally) 
(Encyclopedia Britannica,Chess.com).Players alternate turns aiming to put the opponent’s king in checkmate—threatening capture with no escape—while special rules like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion add tactical depth (Encyclopedia Britannica,Chess.com)
.Games can also end in a draw through stalemate, agreement, insufficient material, threefold repetition, or the 50‑move rule(Chess.com,
chessstrategyonline.com.

 <h2>Hues & Cues</h2>
   <p>In Hues and Cues, players take turns as the cue giver, who secretly draws a color from the large board of 480 colored squares. The cue giver gives a one-word clue (like "sky" or "grass") to help others guess the exact color. Each other player places a marker on the board where they think the color is, and then the cue giver may give a second one-word clue if needed. Points are scored based on how close guesses are to the correct color, with both guessers and the cue giver earning points. The game continues with new cue givers each round, and the player with the most points after everyone has had a turn wins.Players must be careful with their word choice, since no numbers, letters, or multi-word phrases are allowed as clues. The challenge comes from how differently people perceive colors, making it both a game of creativity and interpretation.
